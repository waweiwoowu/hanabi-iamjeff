## Categories

* ***Finessed Chop***: A term used to describe the situation where a player's *Chop* is also on their *Fienssed Position*.

### Non-Emergency Chop Moves

* If you have two or more unknown 1s: ***[Order Chop Move](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/Reference.md#the-order-chop-move--the-skipped-order-chop-move)***
  * Skip 1 card: *Single Chop Move*
  * Skip 2 cards: *Double Chop Move*
  * And so on...
* If you have two or more unknown 1s, instead of performing an *Order Chop Move*, you give a direct *Save Clue* touching **only one** card on your teammate's *Chop*: ***[Redundant Save Chop Move](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/misc/Deleted_Conventions.md#the-redundant-save-chop-move)***
* If your teammate has a 5 which is one-away from chop: ***[5's Chop Move](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/Reference.md#the-5s-chop-move)***
  * Remember it is just a *5 Stall* if you are in *8 Clues Situation*.
* If your teammate has a trash: ***[Trash Chop Move](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/Reference.md#the-trash-chop-move)***
  * Note that it should always be interpreted as a *Trash Chop Move* instead of a *Positional Clue* in the variants with a Null suit (or any variant relied on *Positional Clues*).
* If your teammate has an unknown trash (clued), and if they are not locked, you can give a *Fix Clue* on their trash: ***[Transfer Chop Move](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/Reference.md#the-chop-transfer)***
  * Note that you can also do this with a *Chop Moved* card.
* If your teammate has a playable card through your own hand: ***[Selfish Chop Move](Selfish_Conventions.md#selfish-chop-move)***
* If your teammate has a clued card and you give a *Tempo Clue* in special circumstances: ***[Tempo Clue Chop Move](Score_Hunting_Guide.md#tempo-clue-chop-move-exception)***
* If your teammate has a card of one-of-each suit and it is one-away from chop: ***[Dark Chop Move](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/misc/2-Player.md#the-dark-chop-move)***



### Semi-Emergency Chop Moves (without wasting a clue)

> ***Important Notes***: If your teammate has a critical card on their *Finessed Chop*. In this situation, **do not** lock your teammate by giving (wasting) a direct *Save Clue*, unless there are more than 5 clues in the bank. Simply "save" it with one of the following *Chop Moves* to generate more clues for your teammate to survive while they are locked.
* If you have a playable card: ***[Scream Discard Chop Move](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/Reference.md#the-scream-discard-chop-move-deliberately-discarding-instead-of-playing)***
* If you don't have a playable card: ***[Skipped Discard Chop Move](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/misc/2-Player.md#the-skipped-discard-chop-move)***
* If you have a trash: ***[Whisper Discard Chop Move](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/Reference.md#the-whisper-discard-chop-move)***
* If you have two or more trash: ***[Trash Order Chop Move](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/Reference.md#trash-order-chop-move)***

### Emergency Chop Moves

* If your teammate has two cards to save: ***[Double Scream Blind-Play (Blind-Playing Chop)](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/misc/2-Player.md#the-double-scream-blind-play-blind-playing-chop)***
* If your teammate has three or more cards to save: ***[Misplay Chop Move](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/Reference.md#the-misplay-chop-move)***
* If your teammate has a critical card on their *Finessed Chop* while you're locked: ***[Sacrifice Discard Chop Move](Score_Hunting_Guide.md#sacrifice-discard-chop-move)***

## Context

* *Chop Moves* can be performed and read through *Context*.

### Trash Chop Move (with a stale 1)

* If a player recieves a 1 clue (one or more away from *Chop*) and they have enough context knowing that it is not a playable 1. In this situation, the clue should be interpreted as a *Trash Chop Move*.
* For example:
  * Red 1 has been played on the red stack.
  * Alice discards. Bob discards.
  * Alice gives a 1 clue touching a 1 on Bob's slot 3.
  * Generally, it is a *Play Clue* on the 1. However, if it is playable, Alice won't discard last turn. Therefore, it must be a red 1 which is trash.
  * Bob discards the red 1 from slot 3 and *Chop Move* his slot 4 and 5.

### Delayed Chop Move (on a critical card)

* If a player recieves a *Chop Move* after their teammate discards a non-trash card, and they have enough context knowing that their *Chop* was not important. In this situation, the *Chop Moved* card must be the other copy of the card that their teammate just discarded.
* For example:
  * Alice discards. Bob discards a green 4.
  * Alice gives 5 clue on Bob's *Chop* as a *5 Save*.
  * Bob gives a 5 clue touching a 5 on Alice's slot 4 (one away from *Chop*). It is a *5's Chop Move*.
  * Normally, the players are supposed to *Chop Move* an important card(s) as soon as possible. If Alice had an important card on *Chop*, Bob would perform a *5's Chop Move* last turn.
  * Since Bob discarded last turn, it tells Alice that her *Chop* was not important. What's the reason Bob does a *Chop Move* this turn? Her *Chop* card must be important right now.
  * Since Bob discarded a green 4 last turn; thus, the *Chop Moved* card must be the other copy of green 4.
  * Alice marks her slot 5 as a green 4 and discards her slot 3.

### Delayed Chop Move (on a playable card)

* If a player recieves a *Chop Move* after giving a direct *Play Clue* on their teammate, and they have enough context knowing that their *Chop* was not important. In this situation, the *Chop Moved* card must be a playable card through their teammate's hand.
* For example:
  * All 1's are played on the stacks.
  * Alice discards. Bob discards **a trash**.
  * Alice gives a red clue touching a red 2 on Bob's slot 1.
  * Bob gives a 5 clue touching a 5 on Alice's slot 4 (one away from *Chop*). It is a *5's Chop Move*.
  * Normally, the players are supposed to *Chop Move* an important card(s) as soon as possible. If Alice had an important card on *Chop*, Bob would perform a *5's Chop Move* last turn.
  * Since Bob discarded last turn, it tells Alice that her *Chop* was not important. What's the reason Bob does a *Chop Move* this turn? Her *Chop* card must be important right now.
  * Since Bob discarded a trash last turn, her *Chop Moved* card cannot be a critical card. Thus, it must be a red 3 that Bob wants to protect after receiving the red clue.
  * Alice marks her slot 5 as a red 3 and discards her slot 3.
  * Bob plays red 2. Alice blind-plays her slot 5, and a red 3 is successfully played.
