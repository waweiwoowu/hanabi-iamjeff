## Non-Emergency Chop Moves

### [Order Chop Move](https://hanabi.github.io/docs/level-6/#the-order-chop-move-ocm)
- If the player has two or more unknown playable 1s, they are allowed to play the 1s which is *Out-of-Order* to signal an *Order Chop Move*.
  - Skip 1 card: *Single Chop Move*
  - Skip 2 cards: *Double Chop Move*
  - And so on...

### [Redundant Save Chop Move](https://github.com/hanabi/hanabi.github.io/blob/main/misc/deleted-conventions.md#the-redundant-save-chop-move)
- If the player has two or more unknown playable 1s, instead of performing an *Order Chop Move*, they give a direct *Save Clue* touching **only one** card on their teammate's *Chop*, it signals a *Redundant Save Chop Move*.
- Note that this move has been rarely used.

### [5's Chop Move](https://hanabi.github.io/docs/level-4/#the-5s-chop-move-5cm)
- If the teammate has a 5 which is one-away-from-chop, the player is allowed to give a 5 clue as a *5's Chop Move*.
- Note that it is turned off in *8 Clues Situation*, including the *First Turn*.

### [Trash Chop Move](https://hanabi.github.io/docs/level-4/#the-trash-chop-move)
- If the teammate has a trash which is off-chop, the player is allowed to give a clue touching that trash (if it looks like a known trash) and it signals a *Trash Chop Move* to the right of the clued card.
- Note that it should always be treated as a *Trash Chop Move* over a *Positional Clue* in the variants with a Null suit (or any variant which is relied on *Positional Clues*).

### [Trash Order Chop Move](https://hanabi.github.io/docs/level-6/#the-trash-order-chop-move-tocm)
- If the player has two or more trash, they are allowed to discard the trash which is *Out-of-Order* (from right to left) to signal a *Trash Order Chop Move*.

### [Shout Discard Chop Move](https://hanabi.github.io/docs/level-6/#the-scream-discard-chop-move-sdcm)
- Similar to a *Scream Discard Chop Move* (see below), if the player has a playable card while holding a known trash, they are allowed to perform a *Shout Discard Chop Move* by discarding the known trash.

### [Tempo Clue Chop Move](Score_Hunting_Guide.md#advanced-form-of-tempo-clue-chop-move)
- If the teammate has an unknown playable card which has been clued earlier, the player is allowed to give a *Tempo Clue* in some circumstances to signal a *Tempo Clue Chop Move*.

### [Dupe Chop Move](Score_Hunting_Guide.md#dupe-chop-move-risk-of-duplication-chop-move)
- If the player has an unknown playable card (usually a 1), they are allowed to give a **1-for-1** clue that might be *Duped* to signal a *Dupe Chop Move*.

### [Selfish Chop Move](Selfish_Conventions.md#selfish-chop-move)
- If the player has a playable card, they are allowed to defer a *Play* and give a *Selfish Clue* through their own hand. In some circumstances, the move signals a *Selfish Chop Move*.
- Click the link and see more details.

### [Transfer Chop Move](https://hanabi.github.io/docs/extras/chop-moves/#the-chop-transfer)
- If the teammate has an unknown trash which has been clued earlier, the player is allowed to give a *Fix Clue* on the trash and it signals a *Transfer Chop Move*.
- Note that the players can also perform this move by touching a *Chop Moved* card.

### [Dark Chop Move](https://github.com/hanabi/hanabi.github.io/blob/main/misc/2-player.md#the-dark-chop-move)
- If the teammate has a card of an One-of-Each suit which is one-away-from-chop, the player is allowed to "early" save it with a *Color Clue* which signals a *Dark Chop Move*.
- Note that this move has been rarely used due to the existence of a *Self-Color Bluff*.

<br/>

## Emergency Chop Moves

- These are the *Chop Moves* for an emergency. Note that they are risky which might cause a bomb or make a critical card being discarded.
- A ***Finesse Chop*** is a term used to describe a situation where a player's *Chop* is also on their *Finesse Position*.
- If the teammate has a critical card (or an extremely important card) on their *Finesse Chop*, **do not** lock your teammate by giving (wasting) a direct *Save Clue*, unless the team has enough clue tokens (usually 5 or more). In this situation, simply "*Save*" it with one of the following *Emergency Chop Moves* to generate more clues for teammate to stall (survive).

### [Skipped Discard Chop Move](https://github.com/hanabi/hanabi.github.io/blob/main/misc/2-player.md#the-skipped-discard-chop-move)
- If the player doesn't have a playable card, they are allowed to discard a card which is one-away-from-chop to signal a *Skipped Discard Chop Move*.

### [Scream Discard Chop Move](https://hanabi.github.io/docs/level-6/#the-scream-discard-chop-move-sdcm)
- If the player has a playable card, they are allowed to perform a *Scream Discard Chop Move* by discarding their *Chop* card.
- Note that the players are allowed to perform this move even if they are not in 0 clues.

### [Whisper Discard Chop Move](https://hanabi.github.io/docs/level-6/#the-scream-discard-chop-move-sdcm)
- Similar to a *Scream Discard Chop Move*, if the player has a known trash (without holding a playable card), they are allowed to perform a *Whisper Discard Chop Move* by discarding the *Chop* card instead of the known trash.
- Note that it has been renamed as a *Scream Discard Chop Move* in h-group document.

### [Bomb Chop Move](https://github.com/hanabi/hanabi.github.io/blob/main/misc/2-player.md#the-scream-blind-play-blind-playing-chop)
- If the teammate has two cards to be saved, the player is allowed to misplay their *Chop* card as a *Bomb Chop Move* to signal a *Double Chop Move* on their teammate.

### [Misplay Chop Move](https://hanabi.github.io/docs/extras/chop-moves/#the-misplay-chop-move)
- If the teammate has three or more cards to be saved, the player is allowed to give a direct *Play Clue* on an unplayable card which causes a bomb. In this situation, it signals a *Misplay Chop Move* to the right of the clued cards.

### [Sacrifice Discard Chop Move](Score_Hunting_Guide.md#sacrifice-discard-chop-move)
- If the player is locked and their teammate has a critical card on their *Finesse Chop*, they are allowed to discard a clued card to signal a *Sacrifice Discard Chop Move* on their teammate.

## Context

- *Chop Moves* can be performed and be read through *Context*.

### Trash Chop Move (with a stale 1)

- If the player recieves a 1 clue which is one-or-more-away-from-chop and they have enough context knowing that it is not playable. In this situation, the clue should be interpreted as a *Trash Chop Move*.
- For example:
  - Red 1 has been played on the stack.
  - Alice discards. Bob discards.
  - Alice gives a 1 clue touching a 1 in Bob's slot 3.
  - Normally, it means a *Play Clue* on the 1. However, if it was playable, Alice wouldn't discard last turn. Therefore from context, it must be trash.
  - Bob discards the red 1 (from slot 3) and *Chop Moves* his slot 4 and 5.

### Delayed Chop Move (on a critical card)

- If the player recieves a *Chop Move* right after their teammate discarded a non-trash card, and they have enough context knowing that their *Chop* was not important. In this situation, the *Chop Moved* card must be the other copy of the card which has been discarded.
- For example:
  - Alice discards. Bob discards a green 4.
  - Alice gives 5 clue to Bob as a *5 Save*.
  - Bob gives a 5 clue to Alice touching a 5 which is one-away-from-chop. It signals a *5's Chop Move*.
  - Normally, the players are supposed to save a critical card before they discard. If Alice had a critical card on *Chop*, Bob would perform a *5's Chop Move* last turn.
  - Bob discarded last turn, which means the card on Alice's *Chop* was not "important". What's the reason why Bob does a *Chop Move* right after they discarded? Alice's *Chop* must be important right now.
  * Since Bob discarded a green 4 last turn, which implies that the *Chop Moved* card must be the other copy of the green 4.
  * Alice marks her slot 5 as a green 4 and does something unrelated.

### Delayed Chop Move (on a playable card)

- If a player recieves a *Chop Move* right after they give a direct *Play Clue* to their teammate, and they have enough context knowing that their *Chop* was not important. In this situation, the *Chop Moved* card must be a playable card through their teammate's hand.
- For example:
  - All 2's are played on the stacks.
  - Alice discards. Bob discards **a trash**.
  - Alice gives a red clue to Bob touching a red 3 in slot 1.
  - Bob gives a 5 clue to Alice touching a 5 which is one-away-from-chop. It signals a *5's Chop Move*.
  - Normally, the players are supposed to protect an important card before they discard. If Alice had an important card on *Chop*, Bob would perform a *5's Chop Move* last turn.
  - Bob discarded last turn, which means the card on Alice's *Chop* was not important. What's the reason why Bob does a *Chop Move* right after they discarded? Alice's *Chop* must be important right now.
  - Since Bob discarded a trash last turn, Alice's *Chop Moved* card cannot be a critical card. Thus, it must be a red 4 that Bob intended to protect after receiving a red clue.
  - Alice marks her slot 5 as a red 4 and does something unrelated.
  - Bob plays red 3.
  - Alice blind-plays her slot 5. It is a red 4 and it successfully plays.
