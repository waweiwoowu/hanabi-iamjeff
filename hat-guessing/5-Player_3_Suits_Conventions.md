# 5-Player 3 Suits Conventions

This is document of the conventions for 5-Player 3 Suits games using [advanced hat-guessing conventions](https://github.com/waweiwoowu/hanabi/blob/master/hat-guessing/Advanced_Hat_Guessing.md) invented by [IAMJEFF](https://github.com/waweiwoowu) in April 2020.

## General Conventions

### Clue Planning

* Give _**Action Clues**_ until getting **7** or more cards to play, including the cards which are loaded by the action clue.
  * Tips: While giving an action clue, you should always touch cards with higher rank (e.g. 4 or 5), since you would probably need those cards in last round.
  *  12 cards for *Synesthesia & Black (4 Suits)*
* Then, every clue should be given as an _**Information Clue**_ _(see below)_.
* Notes: For the variants where the clue gives both positive number or positive color information, like No Variant, the team can choose to give normal _Play Clues_ (with [Hyphen-ated Conventions](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/Reference.md)) instead of information clues. They have to decide this at the start of the game.

### Information Point
* Each card has an _Information Point_, with the priority as follows:
  1) Rank: 1 < 2 < 3 < 4 < 5
  2) Color: red (left-most color) < green < blue (right-most color)
* For example:
  * Green 3 < Green 4 < Green 5
  * Red 4 < Green 4 < Blue 4
  * Blue 3 < Green 4 < Red 5

### Information Clue Rules

* If a card has been assigned with an information clue, treat it as a known useful card.
* **Do not** count the known useful cards while giving an information clue.
* **Do not** count the card which has been assigned with an action clue.
* If the players have no useful cards (or all of their useful cards are known), assign them with `0`.
* If the players have only one known useful card (from previous information clues) and they play another playable card (from previous action clues):
  * If they draw a trash, assign them with `0`.
  * If they draw a useful card with higher rank, assign them with `1`.
  * If they draw the other copy of the known useful card, **reassign** their known useful card, i.e. with `2`, `3`, or `4`. (It gives more information to their known useful card.)
  * If they draw a useful card with lower rank, assign them with `5`.
* If the players who have two or more **unknown** useful cards and one of them is unique (e.g. a 5), and if everyone knows they can only play one card for the rest of the game, only count that unique card while giving an information clue.
* If a players have three or more **unknown** useful cards, only count the cards with highest and lowest points while giving a clue.
