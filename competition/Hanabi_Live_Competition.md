# Welcome Hanabi Live Competitors!
* Hosted by IAMJEFF and Dr_Kakashi

### Mission:
Our goal is to have weekly competitions to have teams compete against one another playing Hanabi with identical decks.  These are special challenges that will bring a competitive atmosphere where anyone can join to show off their skills.  

<br/>

### Standard Scoring
* Game points = Total Max Score + Bonus Points
* Bonus Points = (# of cards left in the deck + # of clues left) * 0.1
  * Example:
You score 24 points with 3 cards remaining in deck and have 2 clues.
Total Max Score = 24
Bonus Points = 3 + 2 = 5 * 0.1 = 0.5
Game Points = 24 + 0.5 = 24.5
* A bombed deck (3 strikes) will only score the points they’ve received up to that point
  * Example
You score 10 points, but received a 3rd strike to end the game.  Game Points will be 10 and no bonus points will be awarded.  
Thus, you are more inclined to complete a game as you will receive bonus points for doing so. 
* Special Rules:  Depending on the event we may specify specials rules that will be stated in the event’s description

### Victory Points
* The number of victory points a team receives will be the average of their best 3 out of 4 games.
  * Example:
You played 4 games and received scores of 20, 25, 18, 14
Total Victory Points = 20 + 25 + 18 = 21
This is setup such that a really bad game doesn’t destroy the team’s success/chance.  It really gives you 1 warmup game essentially.
